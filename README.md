A program to find possible words given the constraints of a cryptogram puzzle.
You will need to open the program in a text editor that has a command line. The program will prompt you to enter a string of numbers. Starting at 0 and counting up, give
  each distinct letter in the encoded word the next number. The program will output a list of all words that fit the word-scheme.
